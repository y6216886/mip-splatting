/root/miniconda3/envs/mip-splatting/lib/python3.8/site-packages/torchvision/models/_utils.py:223: UserWarning: Arguments other than a weight enum or `None` for 'weights' are deprecated since 0.13 and will be removed in 0.15. The current behavior is equivalent to passing `weights=MaskRCNN_ResNet50_FPN_Weights.COCO_V1`. You can also use `weights=MaskRCNN_ResNet50_FPN_Weights.DEFAULT` to get the most up-to-date weights.
